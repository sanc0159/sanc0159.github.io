            Hello everyone! My name is Verónica Sánchez Guerra, I was born 26 years ago, on the 26<sup>th</sup> of September in a beautiful country called Colombia. <em>I'm a Libra</em> and I love to guess everybody's zodiac sign... I always fail. I like cats, tattoos, 90s-2000s pop music and taking long walks without a planned destination, I feel most alive when I'm laughing or strongly focused on a task, as I love feeling useful.
        </p>

            My biggest dream in life is to be on a <em>Disney film production</em>, I wish to create new narratives or scenarios for the whole world to see and feel. This all started back when I was just a kid watching <abbr title="Video Home System">VHS</abbr> Disney movies with my sister, I would go wild thinking about the many opportunities to change the story. I dream of just creating beautiful film productions with my name on the creddits and sharing them with the people I love and admire.
